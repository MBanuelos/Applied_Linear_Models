## What is R?
R is a free, open-source software and programming language developed in 1995 at the University of Auckland as an environment for statistical computing and graphics <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/R-paper.pdf"> (Ikaha and Gentleman, 1996) </a>. Since then, R has become a popular software environment for data analysis in a variety of disciplines.

### Why Should I Learn R?

* It is free and it is a widely used statistical programming language!
* Reproducible Research
* <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/"> Community Resources </a>
* Learning Resources
  * ISLR Textbook
  * <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/"> RStudio Cheat Sheets </a>
  * <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/"> R Basics </a>
  * <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html"> ggplot2 </a>

## RStudio

RStudio has 4 main window panes that allows for 

 * *Script / Editing Pane*
    * This area allows you to write scripts or entire R Notebooks
 * *Console*
    * This interactive area executes code (line-by-line) as you type it
 * *File Navigator / Plot Viewer / Help Pane*
    * Shows your current working folder and displays plots + help
 * *Environment Pane*
    * Shows any global variables that you can access / manipulate
    
    
### R - Console
We will write some code to execute in the R Console, covering:

  * Simple Arithmetic
  * Variables and Variable Assignment
  
```{r}
# Here, we will explore how to use R as a calculator!
```

## R Markdown Notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Code can be placed in code chunks and run indepedently.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.


```{r}
# simple R code chunk
x <- 2
y <- 5
x + y
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Note: comments start with a #. It's a great idea to comment your # code.

## ggplot and Data

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(ISLR)
```

We will use the `ggplot()` function to build plots. Some things to note:

* The first argument is always the dataset
* Next, provide the variables from the data to be assigned to `aes`thetic elements of the plot (x and y)
* Finally, you add a layer with a `+` to specify a `geom`etric object

```{r}
# load data
data("textbooks")
```

```{r}
# create a histogram of the data
ggplot(data = textbooks, aes(x = uclaNew), ) + 
  geom_histogram()
```


What are some observations you notice? 

**Practice:** Create a new `R` chunk and 

  1. Create a histogram of the costs of textbooks (on Amazon) - `amazNew`. What do you notice when compared to the `uclaNew` histogram?


---

```{r}
# creating boxplots
ggplot(data = textbooks, aes(x=more, y=diff)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Loading your own data

If you want to use your own data or analyze existing data (for example <a href=https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F04rjg> Google Trends </a>), you can do so by loading it directly into `RStudio`.

```{r}
# read the multiTimeline.csv file and skip the first line
math.search <- read.csv('multiTimeline.csv', skip = 1, col.names = c('Month','Math'))
# create a new column with the date
math.search$Date <- as.Date(paste(math.search$Month,"-01",sep=""))
# create a plot
ggplot(data = math.search, aes(x=Date, y=Math, group=1)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() 
```

---

## Creating Statistical Models

```{r}
data(Auto)

# Practice! Create a scatterplot with geom_point() of mpg (y) vs horsepower (x)
ggplot() +
  geom_point() 
```

```{r}
# create a linear simple model
my.lm <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data=Auto)
summary(my.lm)
# plot it alongside the data!
```
